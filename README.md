# Analysis of Weather and Vacation Data using APIs


## General Overview

This was an assignment I completed for the Northwestern Data Science and Vizualization Bootcamp. I received an A.

I used Jupyter Notebook to extract weather and vacation data from APIs.

## Weather Data

1. Extracted weather data from [openweathermap.org](https://api.openweathermap.org).
- Converted each successive API call to a json object.
