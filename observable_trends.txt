Six observable trends

1. There is a moderately strong inverted u-shape relationship between latitude and temperature. Temperature is highest at or slightly north of the equator and decreases when moving away from the equator in either direction. This finding is consistent with conventional wisdom.

2. In the Northern Hemisphere (i.e., latitude >= 0) regression analysis indicates that 44% of the variation in temperature is explained by latitude.

3. In the Southern Hemisphere (i.e., latitude < 0) regression analysis reveals that latitude explains 57% of the variation in temperature. The finding of a stronger relationship in the Southern Hemisphere is interesting. The reason may have to do with the non-linear relationship observed in the northern hemisphere. Specifically, initially, as one moves north of the equator temperature actually increases slightly, but displays a net decrease over the entire range of latitudes.

4. There is no evidence of a relationship between latitude and humidity for either hemisphere, ps > 0.05. A p value above 5% suggests that the probability that the observed relationship is due to chance is above 5%.

5. There is no evidence of a relationship between latitude and cloudiness for either hemisphere, ps > 0.05. A p value above 5% suggests that the probability that the observed relationship is due to chance is above 5%.

6. In the U.S., an examination of the humidity heat map reveals that the west coast had the highest humidities. Humidities were very high in the San Francisco and San Jose areas.
